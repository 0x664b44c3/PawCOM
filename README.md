# PawCOM - a Partyline Analog (Wired) interCom system

## Scope of this project
This projects implements a partyline analog intercom system as used in the tv and event industry for interconnecting small teams of technical staff.

The system consists of any number from 2 up of so-called beltpacks, portable intercom stations plus a central power supply.
The portable parts are interconnected by generic microphone cabling (industry standard) and is electrically compatible to ClearCom, RTS and others.
Analog circuitry was inspired by the classic ClearCom MR102 and others but has been re-engineered from the ground up to use modern components and
add a few extra features.
